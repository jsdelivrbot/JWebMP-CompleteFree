/**
 * Inline forms
 * <p>
 * Use the .form-inline class to display a series of labels, form controls, and buttons on a single horizontal row. Form controls within inline forms vary slightly from their default states.
 * <p>
 * Controls are display: flex, collapsing any HTML white space and allowing you to provide alignment control with spacing and flexbox utilities. Controls and input groups receive width: auto to
 * override the Bootstrap default width: 100%. Controls only appear inline in viewports that are at least 576px wide to account for narrow viewports on mobile devices.
 * <p>
 * You may need to manually address the width and alignment of individual form controls with spacing utilities (as shown below).
 * <p>
 * Lastly, be sure to always include a label with each form control, even if you need to hide it from non-screenreader visitors with .sr-only.
