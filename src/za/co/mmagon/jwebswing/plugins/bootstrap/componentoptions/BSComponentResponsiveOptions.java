/**
 * Responsive utilities
 * <p>
 * For faster mobile-friendly development, use these utility classes for showing and hiding content by device via media query. Also included are utility classes for toggling content when printed.
 * <p>
 * Try to use these on a limited basis and avoid creating entirely different versions of the same site. Instead, use them to complement each device’s presentation. Available classes
 * <p>
 * The .hidden-*-up classes hide the element when the viewport is at the given breakpoint or wider. For example, .hidden-md-up hides an element on medium, large, and extra-large viewports. The
 * .hidden-*-down classes hide the element when the viewport is at the given breakpoint or smaller. For example, .hidden-md-down hides an element on extra-small, small, and medium viewports. There are
 * no explicit “visible”/”show” responsive utility classes; you make an element visible by simply not hiding it at that breakpoint size. You can combine one .hidden-*-up class with one .hidden-*-down
 * class to show an element only on a given interval of screen sizes. For example, .hidden-sm-down.hidden-xl-up shows the element only on medium and large viewports. Using multiple .hidden-*-up
 * classes or multiple .hidden-*-down classes is redundant and pointless. These classes don’t attempt to accommodate less common cases where an element’s visibility can’t be expressed as a single
 * contiguous range of viewport breakpoint sizes; you will instead need to use custom CSS in such cases.
