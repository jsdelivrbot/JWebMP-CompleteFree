/**
 * Split button dropdowns
 * <p>
 * Similarly, create split button dropdowns with virtually the same markup as single button dropdowns, but with the addition of .dropdown-toggle-split for proper spacing around the dropdown caret.
 * <p>
 * We use this extra class to reduce the horizontal padding on either side of the caret by 25% and remove the margin-left thatâ€™s added for regular button dropdowns. Those extra changes keep the caret
 * centered in the split button and provide a more appropriately sized hit area next to the main button.
