/**
 * This plugin renders checkbox icons in front of each node, making multiple selection much easier.
 * <p>
 * It also supports tri-state behavior, meaning that if a node has a few of its children checked it will be rendered as undetermined,
 * <p>
 * and state will be propagated up. You can also fine tune the cascading options with the cascade config option.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind when cascading checkbox will check even disabled nodes.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Undetermined state is automatically calculated, but if you are using AJAX and loading on demand and want to render a node as underemined pass "undetermined" : true in its state.
